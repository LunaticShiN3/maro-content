My SM64 asm, tweaks, etc. Grouped by the hacks they appeared in.

Some codes might interfere with eachother as they may replace the same addresses. You can tweak them to fix that.

Some codes are unfinished or untested. Keep an eye on their descriptions to see what they do.

Please credit me if you use any of these.
