832 STAR TWEAK
Version 1.1.1
Made by ShiN3, please credit if used.

832 star limit only applies if the 8 stars per level patch is applied. With 7 stars per level, the limit is 728.
8 stars per level patch by FramePerfection, included here.

You must use the skip file select tweak, as all save files will be combined.
This patch works by changing the current save file during gameplay, which will allow each area to contribute stars to a different save file.
To decide which save file an area counts towards, add an object with behavior ID 0x40CD00 and set B Param 1 to the ID of the file you want:
File A = 1
File B = 2
File C = 3
File D = 4

Do not place one of these objects in a level that a success warp leads to (usually the overworld), as switching save files before saving the game
will make the game not actually save.
This means that if you want to place stars in an overworld, all levels in it must be in the same save file as it (unless you have a more complex overworld system like SR4.5)

As of v1.1, flags and switches should work correctly, and each key and switch should work for all files.



As file select is skipped, you won't be able to delete save files normally. To delete a save file, call the following function:
